/* 
  The .blog-grid class is now defined in src/styles/Dashboard.css 
  and is used by both Home.js and Dashboard.js for consistent padding around the grid.
  This file is intentionally left with only comments, as its previous .blog-grid rule
  (which applied margins) is superseded by the padding rule in Dashboard.css.
*/

/* 
  Removed .home-container, .loading-container as PageLayout handles this.
  Removed .blog-card, .blog-card-content, .blog-title-container, .blog-title, 
  .blog-content, .blog-categories, .blog-date, .blog-actions, .premium-chip 
  as these are now handled by the PostCard component using MUI sx props or defaults.
